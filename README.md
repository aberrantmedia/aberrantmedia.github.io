# AberrantMedia
This is the [AberrantMedia github pages site](https://aberrantmedia.github.io/).

It's run on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), because of course it is.

It uses the [Jekyll Clean Dark theme](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark) with some minor modifications (color, header/footer).

It's modified/posts are written/etc. almost entirely via command line, because I hate fun.

And it's basically just a place to talk about what kind of things I'm working on.
